# automator-scripts

A collection of Automator scripts which can be used as macOS services for text editing purposes. They only work within editable text areas that allow the macOS context menu to be displayed (e.g. in applications such as Notes, TextEdit or when editing text inside a web browser).

# Where should I place these .workflow files?

Copy the scripts to the following location on your filesystem: `/Users/<username>/Library/Services` (replace `<username>` with your own username).

# How do I use these quick actions?

Select the portion of text which you wish to modify and right click on the selection to display the context menu. Then navigate to ***Services*** (at the bottom of the list) and choose the desired quick action. 

For faster access, you can alternatively set up a combination of keys for each quick action. You can do this by going to ***System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts*** and then clicking on the ***Services*** item on the left-hand side. Now you can find the newly-added services by scrolling in the panel on the right-hand side and here you can create a shortcut of your choice (just click on the rightmost area of each row). For example, you could use ***CTRL + CMD + B*** for invoking the ***Add Bold Tags*** workflow.
